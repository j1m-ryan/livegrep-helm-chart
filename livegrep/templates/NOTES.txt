Livegrep has been installed.
Wait a moment for the job which fetches the github repo to complete.

To access the frontend:

1. Forward the local port 8080 to the podâ€™s frontend port:
   kubectl port-forward -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} svc/{{ include "livegrep.frontendName" . }} 8080:80

2. Open your browser to:
   http://localhost:8080
